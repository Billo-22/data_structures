# Data Structures Operations in C++

This project is a comprehensive collection of common data structures and their core operations implemented in C++. It is designed to help learners and developers understand the internal workings of data structures by providing clean, well-documented, and modular implementations.
I aimed to make my code as readable and understandable as possible for beginners.

## 📚 Included Data Structures

- Arrays (Dynamic Array)
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Stacks
- Queues (Standard, Circular, Deque)
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
- Heaps
- Hash Tables
- Graphs

## 🔧 Features

- Clean and modular C++ code
- Each data structure is implemented in a separate file/folder
- Demonstration of basic operations: insertion, deletion, search, traversal, etc.
- Easy to extend and customize

## 🧠 Purpose

This repository serves both as:
1. A **learning resource** for students studying data structures.
2. A **reference** for implementing data structures in C++ for real-world applications or technical interviews.
